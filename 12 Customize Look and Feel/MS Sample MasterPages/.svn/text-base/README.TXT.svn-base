Frequently Asked Questions:
============================================================

Q. Where are master pages?
A. Master pages are a feature of ASP.NET 2.0 that work the 
   same way in Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Office 
   SharePoint Server 2007 as they do in ASP.NET 2.0. Using 
   master pages, you can create a single page template and 
   then use that template as the basis for multiple pages 
   in an application, instead of having to build each new 
   page from scratch.


Q. What are the master page samples?
A. Microsoft has made available a package of sample master 
   pages compatible with the Application Templates for 
   Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 to showcase some of the 
   customization options master pages provide. The master 
   pages were built using new CSS and Master Page editing 
   tools within Office SharePoint Designer 2007.


Q. How many sample master pages are included in the download?
   Are any variations included?
A. The download contains four master page sets, each with 
   its own unique look and feel. Each master page set comes 
   in five color variations: blue, orange, red, purple and 
   green.


Q. How do I apply the sample master pages to a SharePoint site?
A. While you are able to view existing and upload new master
   pages from within the SharePoint site administration, 
   you will need a separate SharePoint-compatible editor, 
   such as Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer 2007, to apply 
   a master page to a SharePoint site. For more details on 
   applying a master page to a SharePoint site using Office 
   SharePoint Designer 2007, visit the Office Online help 
   site.

Q. Will SharePoint site themes work with the sample master pages?
A. The sample master pages were designed to be completely 
   compatible with the “Default Theme” site theme. While they 
   may appear to display correctly, some look and feel features 
   of the sample master pages may not render properly when other 
   site themes are applied.

 
Q. Will the sample master pages work with SharePoint Sites 
   other than those created from the Application Templates for 
   Windows SharePoint Services 3.0?
A. These four sample master pages are compatible with the Windows 
   SharePoint Services 3.0 application templates. While some design 
   and functionality features of the sample master pages may display 
   when applied to any other SharePoint site, not all features may 
   work properly. Therefore, Microsoft recommends that these four 
   sample master pages be used out-of-the-box with SharePoint sites 
   created from the application templates only. Customization of the 
   sample master pages is encouraged to use them with other SharePoint 
   sites.


Q. Are the sample master pages supported by Microsoft?
A. Unfortunately, the four example master pages are not supported 
   by Microsoft. They are intended to provide an example of what 
   can be done with master page support in Microsoft Office 
   SharePoint Designer 2007 and the Application Templates for 
   Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.


Q. Can customers, developers, ISVs, solution providers, etc. 
   modify the sample master pages?
A. Yes. While the sample master pages are fully functional and 
   usable out-of-the-box, Microsoft expects that people will 
   custom tailor or build upon them to suit their own needs. This 
   is one of the main goals of the sample master pages, as a 
   demonstration of the site-wide design and functionality control 
   you have when applying master pages.


Q. Where can I find more information about working with and 
   customizing master pages for SharePoint sites?
A. For end-user help and how to articles covering the use of
   master pages within Office SharePoint Server 2007, visit 
   the Office Online help site.
